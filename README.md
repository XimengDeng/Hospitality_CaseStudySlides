**Background:**
Allistar is the largest intergalactic hotelier on the market, serving guests across the universe from their luxury underwater resorts on Jupiter, to business travelers staying for lunar stints, and families looking to explore the stellar Martian landscapes. Allistar’s portfolio is comprised of 15 out of this world hotels with three unique brands that each target a specific customer segment:
- StarSuites: An all-suite style brand whose guestroom inventory consists only of rooms offering more space and furniture, including a designated living area or multiple rooms, designed to give families a comfortable space to relax following a full day of space fun.
- Astra: A focused-service brand that offers quality rooms at quality prices with a limited number of on-site amenities, marketed toward intergalactic business travelers who are looking for a no-frills stay with astronomical value.
- Grand Galactic: Known as the Rolls-Royce of space stays, proprieties under the Grand Galactic flag are known for their incredible planetary views, the best spas in the cosmos, upscale zero-gravity dining, and personalized service – like Marty the Martian, the leading robot concierge, included in each guest room.

Everything was going stellar for Allistar at the beginning of the year 3000. However, in May astronomers discovered a massive asteroid storm that was heading directly toward the Milky Way Galaxy, where the bulk of Allistar’s properties are located. Due to the asteroid storm, space travel became almost impossible with only limited space flights offered to passengers and many earthlings were forced to delay their interstellar vacations.

The effects of the asteroid storm impacted Allistar’s hotels greatly during the storm’s duration. Luckily, once the dust of the storm settled, space travel once again became easily accessible to earthlings. After a shaky year 3000, the executive team at Allistar is looking for you, an external consultant, to provide them with additional clarity into their brands pre-asteroid storm stay patterns and insights regarding stay patterns post the storm. The executive team also needs strong recommendations for how they can expand their hotels, grow their revenue, and continue providing the most extraordinary experiences for their guests in 3001 and beyond.

**Questions to answer:**
1. Based on the data, what insights can you provide Allistar executives about the change in travel and stay patterns following the asteroid storm in May 3000? Please be sure to cover both pre-storm and post-storm patterns to highlight the impact of the asteroid storm on Allistar's brands.
2. Taking those insights into account, how would you use that data to influence Allistar’s new growth strategy?
3. Is there anything else you noticed in the data? What other recommendations or insights would you provide to the Allistar Executives to expand their business?
